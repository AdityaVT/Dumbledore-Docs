Kurtosis measures whether a dataset is more outlier prone or less outlier prone. In a graphical sense, it is used to describe distributions that look normal but have fat or light tails. 

Datasets with lower kurtosis values have light tails, which means the distribution has less outliers. Datasets with fat tails have higher number of outliers.
